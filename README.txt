Randomized Optimization-analysis.pdf contains the analysis of learning models

Primary Topics:

Each Figure has a file named "Plot_Figure_X"
python Plot_Figure_X.py will generate the figure

-Table 2 Fitness Evaluation Time Growth values are caculated in Plot_Figure_3.py
-Table 3 and 4 are generated in Plot_Figure_5 variables
    -Iteration_time_dump.txt contains values used to caculate Table 4
    
-Table 5 is generated via Table_5.py and must be run in the NN_files Folder    

sklearn and numpy are used heavily and cited througout analysis. 
All Neccessary libraries are in requirenments.txt
